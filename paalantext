Dear Sir/Madam,

This is Raman Gupta, a social entrepreneur by choice. After observing some very common issues in my current society i came across an idea "Paalan"  that is an effort to bring social groups like Orphanages, NGO's , Old age homes  and benefactors on a common platform and giving them chance to increase their local out reach by just a single thumb touch.

Currently my idea is in POC state and i am actively looking for promoter / incubator for the same.
I am more keen to have a meeting and discuss with you.

Thanks,
Raman
